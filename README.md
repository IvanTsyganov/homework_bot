## How it works:
You can use this bot for checking your examination status.

You have to get Ya.Practicum token, your own TG-token and your telegram ID and 
insert them to ***env.example*** file. 

Run homework.py to start checking status. 
When you will send your work to reviewer, 
TG-bot will send you notification for all steps 
of checking by reviewer. Also, you will know result 
before it will be sent to e-mail.
